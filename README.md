# Code

This repo contains various bits of code that can be used for competitive programming. Some relatively difficult problems can only be solved using these data structures or algorithms. Readability is a concern, but reducing lines of code is prioritized for use in cheat sheets / team notebooks.

C++ is the default language used here. This choice here is that C++ is usually the fastest language in common use for competitive programming, and that usually C++ can be translated into other languages while the opposite is not necessarily true. Sometimes unique features of C++ is used, but generally it can be converted to other languages without much hassle.

Included is an ICPC style team notebook using the snippets, as well as some benchmarks and test cases for the snippets.

## Information

### Algorithms
* [Binary Search](./snippets/algorithm/binary_search.cpp) - Find the position of a target value within a sorted array.
* [Golden Section Search](./snippets/algorithm/golden_section_search.cpp) - Find the minima or maxima of a function inside an interval. 
* [Min/Max Subarray](./snippets/algorithm/minmax_subarray.cpp) - Find the maximum subarray given an array of integers. Same with minimum subarray.
* [QuickSelect](./snippets/algorithm/quickselect.cpp) - Search for an element in an unsorted array, similar to a binary search but without the sorted restriction. Effectively performs quicksort, but only on the relevant subsections of the array. This does swap elements within the array and will alter the array's ordering.
* [Saddleback Search](./snippets/algorithm/saddleback_seach.cpp) - Given a 2D array sorted on both axis, find if a value exists and return its location.
* [Ternary Search](./snippets/algorithm/ternary_search.cpp) - Given a function, search for the minimum or maximum (or any other unimodal function) of a range. Will do so in `O(log3 n)` where `n` is the range being used.
